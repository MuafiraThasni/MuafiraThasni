Hi, My name is Muafira, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and have done my master's in Guidance Navigation and Control Engineering. 

Since I was young, I always loved and enjoyed playing with mathematics problems. Honestly, I lost this passion in the chaos..!! As I came back for my passion for Mathematics, I fell in love with Data Science and Machine Learning. Finding patterns and making the machine learn about them!!! 

I want to work with others to make the right decisions, data-driven decisions!
