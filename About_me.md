Hi, My name is Muafira, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I hold a bachelor degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 
and I have done my masters in Guidance Navigation and Control Engineering. 

Since I was young, I always loved and enjoyed playing with mathematics problems. Honestly, I lost this passion in the chaos..!!I have been finding my way to that Mathematics, and I felt in love with the Data science and Machine Learning. Finding patterns and make the machine learn about it !!! 

I want to work with others to make right decisions, data driven decisions!
